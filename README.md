## About
A base for MMO games using Godot 4.2. It includes a database, websocket server, dockerfiles for easy and fast deployment, website for account confirmation and documentation. Although it runs in Godot 4.2, I'm almost 100% sure that it can run with other engines.

To run this project you will need:
  - Node.js
  - Git Bash
  - Docker

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pixelrogueart/websocket-dedicated-server.git
cd websocket-dedicated-server
```

## Projects
### Documentation
**Description**: Swagger application for the database & AsyncAPI for the websocket server.

**Usage**:
- To install all libraries run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```
- To run the database documentation locally simply run the command below.
```bash
node database-swagger
```
- For AsyncAPI, copy what's inside of the file asyncapi-server-documentation.yml and paste [HERE](https://studio.asyncapi.com).


### Database
**Description**: Database to login, register and code confirmation.

**Usage**:
- To install all libraries run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```
- To run the database, you'll need:
    - MongoDB Account
    - MongoDB URI, which should be something like this: mongodb+srv://username:password@server.wfidclc.mongodb.net/collectionName;
    - SMTP Service (I recommend Hostinger)
- After your MongoDB and SMTP Service is setup, change the .env variables accordingly.
- To run the database locally, simply run the command below: By default the port is 8080, you can change the variable PORT inside server.js. You need to change to 8081 or any other port to avoid conflict with the websocket server.
```bash
node db
```

### Websocket Server
**Description**: Server to allow communication between peers. It also keeps stored player's last position.


**Usage**:
- To install all libraries run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```
- To run the server locally, simply run the command below. By default the port is 8080, you can change the variable PORT inside server.js.
```bash
node server
```

### Client
**Description**: Godot 4.2 Project to connect with the database & server. [Live Preview](https://pixelrogueart.com/mmo-example)

**Usage**:
- Run the project.godot inside the client folder. 
- In Database.gd, change the variable dbURL to the database URL. If you're running locally, it will be: http://localhost:8080 or another port if you changed.
- In ServerHeader.gd, change the variable _server_url to the Websocket URL. If you're running locally, it will be: http://localhost:8080 or another port if you changed.

### Website

### Docker
**Description**: The docker folder contains a file named 'deploy.sh', which will allow you to easily deploy the database and websocket server into your Google Cloud Run.

**Usage**:
- To run the file you will need: 
    - Git Bash Installed
    - Google Cloud account logged in your local machine
- Then open the GitBash in the docker folder, by right clicking and selecting 'Open Git Bash Here'.
- Run the command below.
```bash
./deploy.sh <GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID> <YOUR_REGION> <DATABASE_PROJECT_NAME> <SERVER_PROJECT_NAME>
```
